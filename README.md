# E-commerce Database Engineering & Analytics Portfolio

## Project Overview
This repository showcases professional SQL skills applied to a mock e-commerce environment. It covers the full lifecycle from database architecture to complex business intelligence reporting.

## Project 1: Database Schema & Architecture
**Goal:** Build a scalable, 3NF-compliant relational database.
- **Normal Form:** Implemented 3rd Normal Form to eliminate data redundancy.
- **Constraints:** Applied Foreign Keys with `ON UPDATE CASCADE` and `ON DELETE RESTRICT` for data integrity.
- **Performance:** Implemented Full-Text indexing for product search and Composite indexing for order history.

## Project 2: Advanced Analytics & KPI Reporting
**Goal:** Transform raw transactional data into actionable business insights.
- **Business Logic:** Created views for Daily Revenue, Top-selling Products, and User Spending.
- **Advanced SQL:** Utilized **CTEs**, **Window Functions** (`DENSE_RANK`), and **Complex Joins**.
- **Optimization:** Used `EXPLAIN` to diagnose query execution plans and ensure index hits.
